# weber_fechner

A psychophysics experiment about Weberâ€“Fechner law based on vision using `bevy` game engine.

Currently, it is just a template for the experiment, and it is not ready for the real experiment.

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic experiment template using `bevy`.
- [x] Show the stimulus and change the frames based on the keyboard input.
- [x] Track the keyboard inputs, Response time, and the correctness of the response.
- [x] Collect the data and save it to a file (Response times, accuracy, and the stimulus parameters etc).
- [ ] Add a small GUI to control the experiment.
